# SteelBrew Corp

Welcome to the public repository for the minimalistic Official SteelBrew Corp web site!

## How to use

We will add instructions on how to contribute and update content later.

### Publish content

_This is for those who wants to create content like blog posts, add images etc._

We use [Sanity](https://sanity.io), a headless CMS to publish and store content. 

ToDo: Instructions

### Development

_This is for those who wants to develop the page with new features and knows their way around web development._

 - We use [GitHub pages](gh_pages) to deploy our SPA. 
 - Read the [Sanity overview docs][sanity_ov] to get a sense of it, and delve deeper in to learn more.

ToDo: Instructions, project details.
